Images are often manipulated with the intent and purpose to benefit one of the parties. In fact, images are often considered as evidence of a fact or reality, therefore, fake news or any form of publication that uses images that have been manipulated in such a way as to have the capability and greater potential for misleading. To detect falsification of the image, image data is needed in large quantities many, and models to process each pixel in the picture. In addition, efficiency and flexibility in data training is also needed to support its use in everyday life. Big data and deep learning concepts is the perfect solution for this problem. Therefore, architecture Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which utilize Error Level Analysis (ELA), forgery detection image can reach 91.83% and convergence only with 9 epochs.
